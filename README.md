# lunar-aiccord-agent
Lunar AIccord is a production-ready, LangGraph-based multi-agent system that turns creative briefs (text + color palettes) into complete, IFRA-aware perfume formulas, a brandable name, and a short narrative. It integrates RAG over Qdrant, optional Azure OpenAI (chat + embeddings), and lightweight local fallbacks, with built-in token accounting and a reproducible pipeline.
